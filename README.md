# ft_gkrellm

Let’s be clear : We don’t want you to fully recode GKrellM. But we want you to make a
clone of it with at least a few features. This subject is not restrictive at all, so feel free
to add whatever you feel is necessary, fun, or interesting. However, a certain number of
mandatory steps will have to be validated first !
